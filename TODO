Future issues
- lazy load images
  - https://www.adamwills.io/blog/responsive-images-hugo/
- duplicate compatibility data into a directory i can access once pcsx2.net is taken up
  - make an action to pull this down periodically
- GDPR cookie stuff?
- opengraph tags
- better themeing on docs page
  - tie it in with main theme
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage
- auto theme detection
- actually add ads, probably don't want full page-width
- compat API integration (make compat rows expandable for the extra info)
  - track active issues / link to them from the compat page
- FLAT icon for favicon would be better, dont skew it 45degs
- translations
- migrate the rest of the articles
  - pagination will look bad
- more taxonomy support (authors as tags for example / further nesting (categories AND tags))
- related articles on article pages
- docs
  - disable pcsx2's repos and use the new sites -- this means PRs are needed and edits can't be done blind by any contributor
  - use kojin's styleguide?
  - add instructions for setting up VS clang formatting - a pass on the docs in general
